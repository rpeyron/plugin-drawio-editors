The AsyncAPI Playground code in playground/ is extracted from the [official asynapi-react repoository](https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi-react)  (Apache Licence 2.0). 
It was cloned the 2023-06-06 from master branch, and should correspond to release v0.24.23.

It is not currently release as npm package by asynacapi team (hope it may be so in the future). 

A few modifications have been done to make the integration work nicely:
- Styles:
  - Some `100vh` have been replace by `100%` and some `height: 100%` have been added
  - Icon size modified to have more readable links
- Links:
  - Broken link has been replace by a direct link to asyncapi latest specification release
